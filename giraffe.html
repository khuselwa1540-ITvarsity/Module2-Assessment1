                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals. A Giraffe could look into a second-story window without even having to stand on its tiptoes.</p>
                <P>Giraffes are so big that they really don't need to hide from predators. There is safety in number! Its hard to pick one giraffe from another when they form a tight group.</P>
                <P>Its easy to understand why giraffes top the list of so many people's wildlife. Their elegant stride, outrageous eyelashes, and can calm expression give them an air of refinement.</P>
                <P><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></P>
                <p>You will find GIRAFFE next to the pen E22, eating grass.</p>
